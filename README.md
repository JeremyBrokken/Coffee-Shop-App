# Coffee-Shop-App
Coffee Shop App is my second xamarin creation.  

## Overview
This is a tabbed page App.  
It displays the items for sale.
It contains the location and information about the store

This would be useful for small coffee shops.
This has the potential to be upgraded to ordering through the app.  

## Getting started
As of yet the app is only available through Visual Studio.  
Most of the app is cosmetic and has no functional use.  
The map is linked to google maps and thus is operational.  

## Design Goals
This is a lightweight app.  

## Detailed Usage
Shops menu items are accessable via the main page.  
ABout page provides shop information.  
Map page shows the location.   

## Developer Info
Map access google maps through web service and therefore is slower
No known bugs
